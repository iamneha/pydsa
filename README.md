## Installation

To install PyDSA, simply run:

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

```python
In [1]: from pydsa import quick_sort

In [2]: a = [2, 10, 10, 2, 7, 7, 2, 5, 4, 10]

In [3]: quick_sort(a)
Out[3]: [2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7, 7, 10, 10, 10]
```

```python
In [1]: from pydsa import merge_sort

In [2]: b = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 7, 8, 5]

In [3]: merge_sort(b)
Out[3]: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9]

```

## Development Environment

The source code is managed with the Git version control system. To get the latest development version and access to the full repository, clone the repository from Github with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pydsa/pydsa.git
```

You should then install the development requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests:

```
$ py.test
```

### Code Analysis

[`coala`](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala) is used to lint and format
code.

To analyze code using `coala`:

```
$ coala
```

There also other checks that you can run with coala:

```
$ coala pylint # checks the whole codebase against pylint.
$ coala invalidlinks # checks docs for invalid links.
$ coala imports # sort imports
```
